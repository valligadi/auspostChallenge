The solution for the challenge is to write a batch apex to collect all closed cases with empty secret key and pass them to API in execute method in the chunks of 100, as there can only be 100 api calls in single execution and the API is not bulkified to accept a list of cases. I have scheduled this batch in its finally method after 30mins of the first execution. Alternatively we can use a schedule class also and manually schedule it.
Also, since the case can be modified after it is closed by another user and by the time its picked by the batch, the lastmodifiedby may not be the same user who closed it, So I have created a field on case called userWhoClosed__c and populating it in casetrigger.
Since the number of asynchronous method executions in the org is limited to 250k in 24 hour period, it is advisable to get more limits from salesforce or just wait until the limits are made available the next day. But, I donâ€™t think we will hit the limits here. Considering the working hours to be 8 hours and 200 cases closing per minute, we would maximum have 96k records. If each execute method is processing 100 records, then we will have 960 execute method executions which is way under the limit. 
The API callout limit is minimum 100k per 24 hour period. It is advisable to buy more calls from salesforce. But assuming it is 100k, the number of API calls for the above scenario would be 960k which is not too dangerously close to the limit.
